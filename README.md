# Understanding GIS Portfolio

This software is for students of [GEOG30552 Understanding GIS](http://understandingg.is) to create a digital portfolio of their progress, which they can take with them after the course is complete. By using this approach via GitHub, we can easily add a new post each week displaying the map we have created and a brief description, but without having to go to the effort of setting up a blog, or writing website code.

## Quick Start

### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now to your User Repository

Fork this repository by clicking **Fork**. Once this is complete, click **Settings**  and change the name of the repository to **yourgithubusername.github.io**.

Your Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if it's not, you can often force it to build by completing step 2)

### Step 2) Customise and view your site

You can make changes to your file by clicking on `_config.yml` and then pressing the edit button (picture of a pencil).

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options (social media etc.) by editing the _config.yml file.

Making a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon.

You can also add information about yourself by editing `about.md` in the same way. Maybe write a little bit about yourself and what you are hoping to achieve in this course. This is written in **Markdown**, which is a shorthand way of writing  web content. It's pretty easy to understand and more information can be found on this [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/).

### Step 3) Start building your portfolio!

Edit `/_posts/2016-11-22-Template.md` to publish your first portfolio item. Each week, you should add a post showing the map that you have made and a short description. This could include topics such as:

* what the map shows
* what went well when coding it
* what was difficult
* code examples

Once again, this [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy!

You can add as many posts as you like, simply create a new file  in the `_posts` directory named like this: `year-month-day-title.md`.

**More information is given on the [course website](http://understandingg.is).**
